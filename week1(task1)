Let's assume that Destination's IP is 192.168.20.55 (Linux box that you want to access)
We want to access from Linux client with IP 138.47.99.99.
SSH from the destination to the source (with public IP):-ssh -R 19999:localhost:22 sourceuser@138.47.99.99(* port 19999 can be any unused port)
Now we can SSH from source to destination through SSH tunneling:ssh localhost -p 19999
